# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Game Over and Restart
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create game over condition, screen, and restart functionality to complete the game cycle for the MVP
# Details:
1. Implement game over conditions and logic:
   - When player loses all balls
   - When blocks fill the screen/reach bottom boundary
2. Create game over screen with final score display
3. Implement score saving functionality using local storage
4. Implement restart button functionality that fully resets the game state
5. Implement win condition and screen when all blocks are destroyed
6. Create smooth transitions between game states (play → game over/win → restart)

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify game over triggers correctly when player loses all balls
2. Verify game over triggers when blocks reach the bottom boundary
3. Confirm game over screen displays properly with accurate final score
4. Test that high scores are correctly saved to and retrieved from local storage
5. Verify restart button properly resets all game elements and state
6. Confirm win screen appears when all blocks are destroyed
7. Test that state transitions (play → game over/win → restart) work smoothly
