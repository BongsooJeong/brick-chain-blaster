# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Fast-Forward Feature
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add fast-forward functionality to speed up gameplay with visual indicators
# Details:
1. Separate game logic from animation rendering
2. Implement speed multiplier system (1x, 2x, 4x)
3. Create fast-forward button with visual state
4. Add progress bar to show remaining balls/time
5. Implement instant completion option
6. Ensure physics calculations remain accurate at higher speeds
7. Add visual effects to indicate fast-forward state

# Test Strategy:
Test different speed settings for consistency in physics. Verify progress bar accurately reflects remaining time. Test instant completion functionality. Ensure game state remains consistent regardless of speed.
