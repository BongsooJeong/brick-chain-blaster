# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Basic Block System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the block/brick system with HP and collision detection
# Details:
1. Create Block class with HP property
2. Implement visual representation of blocks with different HP levels
3. Setup collision detection between balls and blocks
4. Implement HP reduction on collision with visual feedback
5. Add block destruction animation and sound effects when HP reaches zero
6. Create basic block layout system for testing (advanced patterns will be implemented in later tasks)
7. Implement basic score counting logic when blocks are destroyed

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify blocks render correctly on screen
2. Test block collision and HP reduction when hit by ball
3. Verify visual state changes as HP decreases
4. Confirm blocks are destroyed correctly when HP reaches zero
5. Test destruction effects (animation, sound) play appropriately
6. Verify ball bounces physically correct after block collision
7. Test performance stability with multiple blocks on screen
8. Verify score increases correctly when blocks are destroyed
