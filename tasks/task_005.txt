# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Paddle and Ball Control
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the player-controlled paddle and implement mouse-based aiming and ball launching mechanics for Phase 1 MVP
# Details:
1. Create paddle sprite at bottom of screen
2. Implement mouse control for paddle movement
3. Implement mouse-over aim line visualization
4. Calculate angle between paddle and mouse position
5. Implement click-to-launch single ball mechanics (multiple balls will be in Phase 2)
6. Add physics body to ball with proper collision properties
7. Implement ball-paddle collision logic with appropriate reflection angles
8. Add visual feedback for aiming direction
9. Implement logic for when the ball is missed (falls below screen)

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify paddle moves smoothly with mouse movement
2. Test aim line follows mouse cursor accurately and displays correct angle
3. Verify ball launches in the correct direction based on aim line
4. Test ball-paddle collision behavior and reflection physics
5. Ensure mouse controls are responsive and intuitive
6. Verify appropriate events/handling occur when ball is missed
7. Test overall gameplay flow from aiming to launching to ball interaction
