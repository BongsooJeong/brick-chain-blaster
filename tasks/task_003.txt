# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Ball Chain Firing Mechanism
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core ball chain firing system where multiple balls are fired in sequence along the same trajectory.
# Details:
1. Create Ball component with physics body
2. Implement aiming system with mouse position tracking
3. Create aim line visualization
4. Implement sequential ball firing with configurable delay
5. Add ball return mechanism when all balls are off-screen

```dart
class BallManager {
  final List<Ball> balls = [];
  int ballCount = 1;
  bool isFiring = false;
  Vector2 aimDirection = Vector2(0, -1);
  
  Future<void> fireBalls(Vector2 startPosition, Vector2 direction) async {
    isFiring = true;
    final normalizedDirection = direction.normalized();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < ballCount; i++) {
      final ball = Ball();
      ball.position = startPosition.clone();
      ball.applyLinearImpulse(normalizedDirection.scaled(10));
      balls.add(ball);
      game.add(ball);
      
      // Wait between ball launches
      await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 150));
    }
    
    isFiring = false;
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test aiming with different mouse positions
2. Verify multiple balls fire at the same angle
3. Test collision response of balls with boundaries
4. Measure timing between ball launches
5. Verify ball return mechanism works correctly
6. Test with different ball counts

## 1. Design Ball Chain Firing Mechanism Core Components [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the fundamental structure for the ball chain firing mechanism, including the ball holder, firing pin, and trigger system.
### Details:
Design a system where balls are held in a chain-like structure and can be fired sequentially. The firing pin should be spring-loaded with a hammer mechanism that strikes when triggered. Include a ball seat design that ensures proper positioning before firing.

Design a system where balls are held in a chain-like structure and can be fired sequentially. The firing pin should be spring-loaded with a hammer mechanism that strikes when triggered. Include a ball seat design that ensures proper positioning before firing.

Based on code analysis, we need to enhance several components:

1. BallManager enhancements:
   - Implement a state management system to track ball chain states (ready, loading, firing)
   - Design a spring-loaded firing pin energy system with appropriate animations
   - Create a ball seat component that ensures proper ball alignment before firing
   - Develop chain structure logic for sequential ball firing

2. AimVisualizer improvements:
   - Add visualization for balls in the chain formation
   - Implement visual feedback based on firing readiness state

3. InputHandler refinements:
   - Enhance trigger system with improved drag and tap interactions
   - Add long-press detection for alternative firing modes

4. Maintain existing camera configuration:
   - Continue using fixed 360x640 pixel resolution
   - Preserve automatic zoom calculation based on screen ratio in onGameResize

<info added on 2025-05-14T10:52:38.364Z>
The core components implementation of the ball chain firing mechanism has been completed with the following enhancements:

1. BallManager class has been enhanced with:
   - Ball chain state management system (_BallState class and BallStatus enum)
   - Firing pin energy system with charge, fire, and cancel mechanisms
   - Ball seat design with fine-tuning logic for ball positioning
   - Visual feedback through vibration effects and animations
   - getChainedBallPositions method to calculate positions of all balls in the chain for visualization

2. AimVisualizer class has been improved with:
   - _renderBallChain method to visualize all balls in the chain
   - Visual feedback such as ripple effects during firing preparation
   - Direct coordinate conversion implementation using _convertWorldToScreen method
   - Support for firing cancellation callbacks

3. InputHandler class has been refined with:
   - Long press detection for supporting firing cancellation
   - Immediate upward firing functionality through taps
   - Improved drag cancellation handling

This implementation maintains the existing camera configuration (fixed resolution of 360x640 pixels, dynamic zoom calculation based on screen ratio) while providing all core functionalities of the ball chain firing mechanism.

All components have been designed to work together cohesively, with enhanced visual feedback to improve user experience. Now the balls are displayed as connected in a chain, and the firing preparation and process proceed smoothly.
