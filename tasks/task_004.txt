  List<Brick> generateBricks(int waveIndex) {
    final bricks = <Brick>[];
    final baseHP = calculateBaseHP(waveIndex);
    
    for (int y = 0; y < layout.length; y++) {
      for (int x = 0; x < layout[y].length; x++) {
        if (layout[y][x] > 0) {
          final hp = (baseHP * layout[y][x] * hpMultiplier).round();
          final position = Vector2(x * brickWidth, y * brickHeight);
          bricks.add(Brick(position: position, hp: hp));
        }
      }
    }
    
    return bricks;
