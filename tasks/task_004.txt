# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Game Field and Physics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the basic game field with boundaries and implement Arcade Physics for ball movement as the first implementation task for Phase 1 (Basic Breakout Game MVP)
# Details:
1. Create a new game scene with proper dimensions for desktop
2. Setup Arcade Physics in the scene
3. Implement game boundaries with collision detection
4. Create world bounds that reflect the ball
5. Implement physics properties for the ball's movement and collisions
6. Add debug visualization for physics bodies and collision points during development
7. Ensure consistent physics behavior across different frame rates
8. Set up the basic screen layout and background for the game
9. Add FPS counter and performance metrics for debugging
10. Ensure the game field scales appropriately across different resolutions

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify ball correctly bounces off screen boundaries
2. Confirm physics system operates reliably at consistent FPS
3. Test game field scaling across various resolutions
4. Verify all collision events are properly detected
5. Test ball collision with boundaries
6. Verify physics properties like bounce and velocity behave as expected
7. Test at different frame rates to ensure consistent behavior
