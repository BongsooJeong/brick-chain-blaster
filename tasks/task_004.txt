Develop a data structure to represent different brick patterns (grid, zigzag, circular, etc.). Create a pattern library with predefined formations that can be selected randomly or sequentially. Include parameters for pattern density, symmetry options, and special brick placement rules.

Implemented the BrickPattern class to define various brick arrangement patterns. Created 10 distinct pattern types: basic lines, grids, pyramids, zigzag, fortress, X-shape, arch, diagonal triangles, reinforced center, and diamond patterns. Added pattern variation capabilities including horizontal and vertical flipping. Implemented scaling difficulty where brick HP increases with wave index and the probability of special brick appearances increases in higher waves.

Write functions to translate pattern definitions into actual brick positions. Implement grid-based positioning system with support for offsets. Create methods for random variations within pattern constraints. Ensure proper spacing between bricks using padding parameters.

Implemented the layout algorithm successfully. Created a BrickPattern class with a generateBricks method that converts pattern definitions into actual brick positions. To ensure proper spacing between bricks, set brick sizes to 90% of standard size. Added logic to center patterns on screen. Implemented automatic color determination based on brick type and HP. Also developed the _selectPattern method in the BrickManager class to determine appropriate patterns based on pattern selection and wave progression.

## 3. Create Wave Progression System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design a system that manages level progression through increasingly difficult waves
### Details:
Implement a wave counter and difficulty curve. Create rules for transitioning between waves. Design a system to track player progress and performance metrics. Develop logic for determining when to advance to the next wave based on brick clearance.
<info added on 2025-05-14T11:01:29.292Z>
Implemented a comprehensive wave progression system through the creation of a WaveManager class. This class manages different wave states including preparation, in-progress, cleared, and game over. Added wave transition functionality with a visual countdown (3,2,1) displayed before each wave begins. Implemented automatic progression to the next wave after a brief delay when the current wave is cleared. Enhanced player feedback by adding a debug overlay that displays real-time information such as current wave number, brick count, and ball count. The system successfully tracks player progress and implements the difficulty curve as waves advance, with clear rules for wave transitions based on brick clearance.

## 4. Implement HP Scaling Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Create a system that scales brick health points based on wave progression
### Details:
Develop formulas for calculating brick HP based on current wave number. Create different brick types with base HP values. Implement visual indicators for brick health status. Design special rules for boss or reinforced bricks that appear in later waves.
<info added on 2025-05-14T11:01:44.713Z>
Implemented a logarithmic scaling system for brick HP based on wave progression through the _calculateBaseHP method. The system creates a gradual increase in brick durability as waves progress (Wave 1: HP 1, Wave 2: HP 2, Wave 5: HP 3-4, Wave 10: HP 4-5, etc.). Different brick types have been implemented with varying HP values and color indicators: regular bricks, reinforced bricks (blue color scheme), special bricks (purple color scheme), and boss bricks (dark purple). Higher HP bricks are more difficult to destroy, creating increasing challenge as players advance through waves. The visual color differentiation helps players identify brick types and their relative durability at a glance.

## 5. Develop Brick Visual Representation [done]
### Dependencies: 4.4

Extended the Brick class to implement various visual effects and status indicators. Created a _getColorByType method that automatically determines colors based on brick type and HP. Added rounded corners and internal gradient effects to bricks to enhance aesthetic quality. For bricks with HP greater than 1, small white dots in the center visually indicate remaining HP. Implemented hit animation where bricks temporarily expand and brighten when struck, and a destruction animation where bricks shrink and rotate when destroyed.

Create smooth animations for brick appearance when generating a new level. Implement physics-based animations for brick destruction. Design animations for special events like chain reactions. Optimize animation performance for large numbers of bricks.

The animation system has been successfully implemented with the following features:

1. Added animation timer and state management logic to the Brick class's update method
2. Implemented a pulse effect for brick hits using a sine curve-based animation with the pulseAmount variable
   - When a brick is hit, it slightly enlarges and brightens before returning to its original state
   - Creates a natural-looking response to impacts

3. Created a destruction animation sequence that plays over 0.5 seconds when a brick is destroyed
   - Gradually reduces the brick's size
   - Adds rotation to the brick as it disappears
   - Fades out the brick by decreasing opacity

4. Utilized various Canvas transformation techniques including scale, rotate, and opacity adjustments to create visually appealing animation effects
5. Ensured all animations are optimized for performance when many bricks are on screen simultaneously

Implementation completed with the creation of the BrickManager class to handle brick collections. The class includes functionality for adding, removing, and querying bricks in the collection.

The areAllBricksCleared method was implemented to check if all bricks have been cleared, and a clearBricks method was added to remove all bricks in the current wave. Additionally, collision detection and handling functionality was integrated into the game class to ensure smooth interaction between bricks and balls.
