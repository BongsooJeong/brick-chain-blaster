# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Brick Generation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the pattern-based brick generation system that places bricks in various formations based on wave index.
# Details:
1. Create Brick component with HP system
2. Implement brick pattern library with predefined formations
3. Create pattern selection and transformation logic
4. Implement wave progression system
5. Add brick movement animation (downward shift)

```dart
class BrickPattern {
  final List<List<int>> layout;
  final double hpMultiplier;
  
  BrickPattern(this.layout, {this.hpMultiplier = 1.0});
  
  List<Brick> generateBricks(int waveIndex) {
    final bricks = <Brick>[];
    final baseHP = calculateBaseHP(waveIndex);
    
    for (int y = 0; y < layout.length; y++) {
      for (int x = 0; x < layout[y].length; x++) {
        if (layout[y][x] > 0) {
          final hp = (baseHP * layout[y][x] * hpMultiplier).round();
          final position = Vector2(x * brickWidth, y * brickHeight);
          bricks.add(Brick(position: position, hp: hp));
        }
      }
    }
    
    return bricks;
  }
  
  int calculateBaseHP(int waveIndex) {
    return max(1, waveIndex);
  }
}

# Test Strategy:
1. Test brick generation with different patterns
2. Verify HP scaling with wave progression
3. Test brick placement and alignment
4. Verify brick downward movement animation
5. Test pattern randomization and variation
6. Validate HP visualization on bricks
