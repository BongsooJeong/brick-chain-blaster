# Task ID: 2
# Title: Setup Phaser 3 with TypeScript
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Install and configure Phaser 3 game framework with TypeScript support using create-phaser template as part of the MVP approach
# Details:
1. Install Phaser 3 using `npm install phaser`
2. Setup TypeScript with `npm install typescript ts-loader`
3. Configure tsconfig.json for Phaser compatibility and optimize TypeScript settings
4. Create webpack configuration for development and production
5. Setup development server with hot-reload
6. Create basic game structure following Phaser 3 scene architecture
7. Implement simple loading screen to verify setup
8. Create skeleton structure for game scenes and objects
9. Configure build scripts for production deployment

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify development server runs without errors using `npm start`
2. Confirm basic Phaser scene renders correctly in browser
3. Test TypeScript compilation works correctly with Phaser types
4. Verify hot-reload functionality during development
5. Run `tsc` command to ensure TypeScript compilation completes without errors
6. Test production build using `npm build` command
