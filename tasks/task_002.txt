# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Core Game Loop and Physics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundational game loop with Forge2D physics integration for ball movement and collision detection.
# Details:
1. Create a main game class extending FlameGame with Forge2D
2. Implement game world boundaries with collision walls
3. Setup basic physics parameters (gravity, restitution, friction)
4. Create a game tick system that handles updates at fixed intervals
5. Implement a basic camera system
6. Setup debug rendering for physics bodies during development

```dart
class BrickChainGame extends Forge2DGame {
  BrickChainGame() : super(gravity: Vector2(0, 0));
  
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await super.onLoad();
    // Setup world boundaries
    add(WorldBoundaries());
  }
  
  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    super.update(dt);
    // Game state updates
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test physics simulation with simple objects
2. Verify collision detection works correctly
3. Measure frame rate to ensure smooth performance
4. Test game loop timing consistency
5. Validate boundary collisions work as expected
