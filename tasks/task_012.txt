# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Pattern-Based Block Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a system for generating blocks in predefined patterns with increasing difficulty
# Details:
1. Design pattern library data structure
2. Create several basic block patterns
3. Implement pattern selection and placement logic
4. Add wave-based difficulty progression
5. Implement HP scaling based on wave number
6. Create pattern variations through rotation and mirroring
7. Add random element to pattern selection

# Test Strategy:
Test pattern generation for visual correctness. Verify HP scaling works correctly with wave progression. Test random pattern selection for good distribution. Ensure patterns fit correctly within game boundaries.
