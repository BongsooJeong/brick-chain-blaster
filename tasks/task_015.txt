  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await super.onLoad();
    
    if (isMobile) {
      add(TouchControls());
    } else {
      add(DesktopControls());
    }
    
    // Adjust UI scale based on screen size
    final screenSize = size;
    final uiScale = min(screenSize.x / 1920, screenSize.y / 1080);
    uiCamera.zoom = uiScale;
  }
}

class TouchControls extends Component with HasGameRef {
  Vector2 aimDirection = Vector2(0, -1);
  bool isDragging = false;
  
  @override
  bool onDragStart(DragStartInfo info) {
    if (gameRef.gameState == GameState.aiming) {
      isDragging = true;
      updateAimDirection(info.eventPosition.game);
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
  
  @override
  bool onDragUpdate(DragUpdateInfo info) {
    if (isDragging) {
      updateAimDirection(info.eventPosition.game);
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
  
  @override
  bool onDragEnd(DragEndInfo info) {
    if (isDragging) {
      isDragging = false;
      gameRef.startFiring(aimDirection);
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
  
  void updateAimDirection(Vector2 position) {
    final worldPosition = gameRef.camera.screenToWorld(position);
    aimDirection = (worldPosition - launchPosition).normalized();
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test responsive layout on different screen sizes
2. Verify touch controls work correctly
3. Test virtual HUD buttons functionality
4. Validate orientation changes handling
5. Test UI scaling on different devices
6. Verify platform-specific optimizations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement responsive layout using ConstraintLayout [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a flexible layout system that adapts to different screen sizes using ConstraintLayout as the base for UI elements
### Details:
Use ConstraintLayout to specify position and size of views according to spatial relationships with other views. Set up proper anchoring of UI elements to different corners of the screen using RectTransform components. Implement flexible grids that resize dynamically based on available screen space.

## 2. Design for minimum viable screen width [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Start designing with a 300px width in mind to ensure compatibility with smallest mobile devices
### Details:
Rather than starting with desktop dimensions (1200px+) and scaling down, begin with the smallest supported screen size and scale up. Create layouts that work well at 300px width, then adapt for larger screens. Test on various device sizes to verify proper scaling.

## 3. Implement touch controls system [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Develop intuitive touch input handling to replace mouse/keyboard interactions
### Details:
Create a touch input manager that detects taps, swipes, pinches and other common mobile gestures. Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized (minimum 44x44 points) for finger interaction. Implement proper touch feedback through animations or visual cues.

## 4. Design virtual buttons and on-screen controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Create on-screen UI controls that provide necessary input functionality while minimizing screen space usage
### Details:
Design virtual joysticks, buttons, and other controls that are responsive to touch input. Ensure controls are positioned to avoid obscuring important game elements. Implement opacity adjustments to reduce visual clutter when controls aren't being used.

## 5. Implement orientation handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Add support for both portrait and landscape orientations with appropriate UI adjustments
### Details:
Create separate layouts for portrait and landscape orientations. Implement smooth transitions between orientations. Ensure game elements and UI components reposition appropriately when device orientation changes. Consider locking orientation for gameplay sections if necessary.

## 6. Develop dynamic UI scaling system [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Create a system that automatically scales UI elements based on screen resolution and density
### Details:
Implement media queries or programmatic scaling to adjust UI element sizes based on device characteristics. Use relative units rather than fixed pixel values. Create a consistent visual hierarchy that works across different screen sizes and densities.

## 7. Optimize for platform-specific features [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3, 15.4, 15.5, 15.6
### Description: Implement platform-specific optimizations for iOS and Android
### Details:
Adapt UI to follow platform-specific design guidelines (Material Design for Android, Human Interface Guidelines for iOS). Implement platform-specific features like haptic feedback, native sharing, and notifications. Account for platform differences in navigation patterns and user expectations.

## 8. Implement performance optimizations for mobile [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.6, 15.7
### Description: Optimize game performance for less powerful mobile hardware
### Details:
Reduce polygon counts and texture sizes for mobile rendering. Implement level-of-detail systems that scale complexity based on device capabilities. Optimize memory usage and reduce battery consumption through efficient resource management. Implement frame rate limiting when appropriate.

## 9. Create comprehensive testing plan [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.5, 15.7, 15.8
### Description: Develop a testing strategy covering various devices, screen sizes, and orientations
### Details:
Create a device testing matrix covering different screen sizes, resolutions, and hardware capabilities. Implement automated UI tests to verify layout adaptation. Develop performance benchmarks to ensure acceptable performance across target devices. Plan for user testing sessions with different device types.

## 10. Implement user feedback collection system [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.9
### Description: Create mechanisms to gather and analyze user feedback about the mobile experience
### Details:
Implement in-app feedback forms for reporting issues with specific devices or screen sizes. Create analytics to track user interactions with responsive elements. Develop a system for categorizing and prioritizing user-reported issues related to responsive design. Plan for iterative improvements based on collected feedback.
