# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement UI/UX for Desktop
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the user interface for desktop web browsers with mouse-based controls and responsive design.
# Details:
1. Implement mouse-based aiming system
2. Create responsive layout for different screen sizes
3. Implement game HUD (score, wave, ball count)
4. Add menu system (pause, restart, settings)
5. Create Modern Cool theme with dark background and neon lines
6. Implement mouse wheel scrolling for UI navigation

```dart
class DesktopControls extends Component with HasGameRef {
  Vector2 aimDirection = Vector2(0, -1);
  bool isAiming = false;
  
  @override
  bool onMouseMove(PointerHoverInfo info) {
    if (gameRef.gameState == GameState.aiming) {
      final worldPosition = gameRef.camera.screenToWorld(info.eventPosition.game);
      aimDirection = (worldPosition - launchPosition).normalized();
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
  
  @override
  bool onMouseDown(PointerDownInfo info) {
    if (gameRef.gameState == GameState.aiming) {
      gameRef.startFiring(aimDirection);
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
}

class GameHUD extends PositionComponent with HasGameRef {
  TextComponent scoreText = TextComponent();
  TextComponent waveText = TextComponent();
  TextComponent ballCountText = TextComponent();
  
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    // Setup HUD components with Modern Cool theme
    final textStyle = TextStyle(color: Colors.cyanAccent, fontSize: 24);
    
    scoreText = TextComponent(textRenderer: TextPaint(style: textStyle));
    waveText = TextComponent(textRenderer: TextPaint(style: textStyle));
    ballCountText = TextComponent(textRenderer: TextPaint(style: textStyle));
    
    add(scoreText);
    add(waveText);
    add(ballCountText);
  }
  
  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    scoreText.text = 'Score: ${gameRef.score}';
    waveText.text = 'Wave: ${gameRef.currentWave}';
    ballCountText.text = 'Balls: ${gameRef.ballCount}';
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test aiming system with different mouse positions
2. Verify responsive layout at various screen sizes
3. Test HUD updates with game state changes
4. Validate menu functionality
5. Test theme consistency across all UI elements
6. Verify mouse wheel scrolling in menus
