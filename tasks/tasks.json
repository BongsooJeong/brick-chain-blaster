The firing pin should be spring-loaded with a hammer mechanism that strikes when triggered. Include a ball seat design that ensures proper positioning before firing.\n\nBased on code analysis, we need to enhance several components:\n\n1. BallManager enhancements:\n   - Implement a state management system to track ball chain states (ready, loading, firing)\n   - Design a spring-loaded firing pin energy system with appropriate animations\n   - Create a ball seat component that ensures proper ball alignment before firing\n   - Develop chain structure logic for sequential ball firing\n\n2. AimVisualizer improvements:\n   - Add visualization for balls in the chain formation\n   - Implement visual feedback based on firing readiness state\n\n3. InputHandler refinements:\n   - Enhance trigger system with improved drag and tap interactions\n   - Add long-press detection for alternative firing modes\n\n4. Maintain existing camera configuration:\n   - Continue using fixed 360x640 pixel resolution\n   - Preserve automatic zoom calculation based on screen ratio in onGameResize\n</info added on 2025-05-14T10:48:35.718Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-14T10:52:38.364Z>\nThe core components implementation of the ball chain firing mechanism has been completed with the following enhancements:\n\n1. BallManager class has been enhanced with:\n   - Ball chain state management system (_BallState class and BallStatus enum)\n   - Firing pin energy system with charge, fire, and cancel mechanisms\n   - Ball seat design with fine-tuning logic for ball positioning\n   - Visual feedback through vibration effects and animations\n   - getChainedBallPositions method to calculate positions of all balls in the chain for visualization\n\n2. AimVisualizer class has been improved with:\n   - _renderBallChain method to visualize all balls in the chain\n   - Visual feedback such as ripple effects during firing preparation\n   - Direct coordinate conversion implementation using _convertWorldToScreen method\n   - Support for firing cancellation callbacks\n\n3. InputHandler class has been refined with:\n   - Long press detection for supporting firing cancellation\n   - Immediate upward firing functionality through taps\n   - Improved drag cancellation handling\n\nThis implementation maintains the existing camera configuration (fixed resolution of 360x640 pixels, dynamic zoom calculation based on screen ratio) while providing all core functionalities of the ball chain firing mechanism.\n\nAll components have been designed to work together cohesively, with enhanced visual feedback to improve user experience. Now the balls are displayed as connected in a chain, and the firing preparation and process proceed smoothly.\n</info added on 2025-05-14T10:52:38.364Z>",

The workflow should include the following steps:\n\n1. **Flutter Web Build Command**: Use the standard Flutter web build command (`flutter build web`) to generate the latest version of the application for web deployment.\n2. **Browser Execution**: Launch the built application in a supported web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to verify functionality and UI behavior.\n3. **Immediate Testing**: After each build, perform manual and automated tests to check for regressions or new issues.\n4. **Debugging Tools**: Utilize browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) for inspecting elements, monitoring network activity, and debugging JavaScript/Dart code.\n5. **Test Documentation**: Document test results, including any issues found, steps to reproduce, and screenshots of both expected and unexpected behaviors.\n6. **Test Checklist**: For each major task (Tasks 1-15), create a checklist of test cases to ensure all critical features are covered. This checklist should be updated as new features are added.\n7. **Screenshot Capture**: Implement a process for capturing screenshots during testing, either manually or using automated tools, to visually document the state of the application at key points.\n8. **Integration with CI/CD**: Optionally, integrate this workflow into a CI/CD pipeline to automate builds, tests, and documentation for every code push.\n\nThis workflow ensures that developers receive immediate feedback on their changes, can quickly identify and fix issues, and maintain a comprehensive record of testing activities.",
      "testStrategy": "To verify the completion and effectiveness of this task, perform the following checks:\n\n- **Build and Run**: Confirm that the Flutter web build command (`flutter build web`) successfully generates the application and that it can be launched in a browser.\n- **Test Execution**: After each build, run both manual and automated tests (using `flutter test` for unit/widget tests and `flutter drive` for integration tests) to ensure all features work as expected[1][2].\n- **Debugging**: Use browser developer tools to inspect elements, debug code, and monitor network requests. Ensure that any issues can be identified and resolved efficiently.\n- **Documentation**: Review the test documentation to ensure it includes detailed descriptions of test cases, results, and screenshots for each major task.\n- **Checklist and Screenshots**: Verify that a test checklist exists for each major task (Tasks 1-15) and that screenshots are captured and stored for key test scenarios.\n- **Automation**: If integrated with CI/CD, confirm that builds, tests, and documentation are triggered automatically on code changes.\n\nThis strategy ensures a robust, repeatable, and well-documented testing and debugging process for Flutter web development.",
