# Task ID: 16
# Title: Establish Web Browser Testing and Debugging Workflow for Flutter Web
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a systematic workflow for testing and debugging in web browsers after each major implementation phase, enabling immediate feedback and documentation of test results.
# Details:
This task involves setting up a repeatable process where, after each significant code change or feature implementation, the Flutter web application is built and run in a browser for live testing and debugging. The workflow should include the following steps:

1. **Flutter Web Build Command**: Use the standard Flutter web build command (`flutter build web`) to generate the latest version of the application for web deployment.
2. **Browser Execution**: Launch the built application in a supported web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to verify functionality and UI behavior.
3. **Immediate Testing**: After each build, perform manual and automated tests to check for regressions or new issues.
4. **Debugging Tools**: Utilize browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) for inspecting elements, monitoring network activity, and debugging JavaScript/Dart code.
5. **Test Documentation**: Document test results, including any issues found, steps to reproduce, and screenshots of both expected and unexpected behaviors.
6. **Test Checklist**: For each major task (Tasks 1-15), create a checklist of test cases to ensure all critical features are covered. This checklist should be updated as new features are added.
7. **Screenshot Capture**: Implement a process for capturing screenshots during testing, either manually or using automated tools, to visually document the state of the application at key points.
8. **Integration with CI/CD**: Optionally, integrate this workflow into a CI/CD pipeline to automate builds, tests, and documentation for every code push.

This workflow ensures that developers receive immediate feedback on their changes, can quickly identify and fix issues, and maintain a comprehensive record of testing activities.

# Test Strategy:
To verify the completion and effectiveness of this task, perform the following checks:

- **Build and Run**: Confirm that the Flutter web build command (`flutter build web`) successfully generates the application and that it can be launched in a browser.
- **Test Execution**: After each build, run both manual and automated tests (using `flutter test` for unit/widget tests and `flutter drive` for integration tests) to ensure all features work as expected[1][2].
- **Debugging**: Use browser developer tools to inspect elements, debug code, and monitor network requests. Ensure that any issues can be identified and resolved efficiently.
- **Documentation**: Review the test documentation to ensure it includes detailed descriptions of test cases, results, and screenshots for each major task.
- **Checklist and Screenshots**: Verify that a test checklist exists for each major task (Tasks 1-15) and that screenshots are captured and stored for key test scenarios.
- **Automation**: If integrated with CI/CD, confirm that builds, tests, and documentation are triggered automatically on code changes.

This strategy ensures a robust, repeatable, and well-documented testing and debugging process for Flutter web development.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Flutter Web Build Process [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure and standardize the Flutter web build command to generate the latest web application version after each major implementation phase.

## 3. Integrate Browser Debugging Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Utilize browser developer tools such as Chrome DevTools to inspect elements, monitor network activity, and debug JavaScript/Dart code during testing.
### Details:
Leverage features like element inspection, console debugging, and network monitoring to identify and resolve issues efficiently during the testing phase.

## 4. Develop Test Documentation and Checklist [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Create and maintain comprehensive documentation of test results, including issues found, reproduction steps, screenshots, and a checklist of test cases for each major task.
### Details:
Document all testing outcomes systematically and update the test checklist to cover critical features and new additions, ensuring traceability and quality control.

## 5. Establish Screenshot Capture and CI/CD Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3, 16.4
### Description: Implement a process for capturing screenshots during testing and optionally integrate the entire testing and debugging workflow into a CI/CD pipeline for automation.
